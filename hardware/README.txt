#Parts
This is a list of parts that are currently in discussion

## Relays
All relay have a 5V coil 

| Relay  | Dimensions | Number of Cycles | Rating | Coil Current | Cost per Unit |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| [OJS-SS-105HEF](https://www.digikey.ca/en/products/detail/te-connectivity-potter-brumfield-relays/OJS-SS-105HEF-00000/14544478) | 18.2 x 10.2 x 14.8mm | 30000 | 16A 250VAC | 89.3 mA | $2.48 |
| [G5LE-1A-E DC5](https://www.digikey.ca/en/products/detail/omron-electronics-inc-emc-div/G5LE-1A-E-DC5/1277878) | 19 x 22.5 x 16.5mm | 50000 | 16A 250VAC | 79.4 mA | $3.86 |
| [PCFN-112D2M](https://www.digikey.ca/en/products/detail/te-connectivity-potter-brumfield-relays/OJS-SS-105HEF-00000/14544478) | 26 x 16 x 30.4mm | 100000 | 16A 250VAC | 75 mA | $7.03 |

## Current Sensors
Current Sensor need to be researched next

## Regulators
All relay have a 5V coil and an ESP module runs off of 3V3 so two regulator from 120VAC-5VDC and 5VDC-3.3VDC will be required  

### 120VAC-5VDC
May custom design to bring down size if a small one can't be found

### 5VDC-3.3VDC
